FishNet is my own implementation of a convolutional neural network system. I
wrote it as my final project for COMP9417 Machine Learning and Data Mining
at the University of New South Wales in Semester 1, 2018.

Please see my project report, Report.pdf, which includes detailed instructions
for building and running the software.

I have saved some trained network files to

Please download and test them if you are interested.
